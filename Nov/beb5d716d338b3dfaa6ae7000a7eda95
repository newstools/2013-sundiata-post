The Governing Board of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has rated Gov. Sullivan Chime of Enugu State as the best in the provision of welfare for corps members in the country. The Chairman of the board, Chief Gordon Bozimo, announced the rating in Enugu on Tuesday when he led members of the board and management of the establishment on a courtesy visit to the governor. Bozimo said Chime had complimented the efforts of the federal government more than any other state in providing for the upkeep and welfare of the corps members.
“The governor’s support to the NYSC as an establishment is also second to none and is worthy of emulation by others,’’ Bozimo said.
The chairman also commended the state government for the ongoing infrastructure development at the NYSC Orientation Camp in Awgu, including the construction of a hostel to accommodate 800 corps members.
He also thanked the governor for the payment of N10,000 monthly stipend to every corps member posted to the state.
Bozimo disclosed that the NYSC had taken steps to fine-tune its policy of posting corps members to areas of their primary assignment for the benefit of the scheme and the corps members.
He said under the new policy, cognate experience would be taken into consideration.
According to him, in posting corps members, areas of specialisation would be taken into consideration to enable them to acquire cognate experience for their future employment.
The chairman appealed to various organisations to retain some of the corps members posted to them.
Responding, Chime affirmed the readiness of his administration to complement the federal government’s efforts to ensure the actualisation of the scheme.
The governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Amechi Okolo, thanked the board for appreciating the modest achievements of the administration, adding that it would motivate it to do more.

By Pulse Davido, the real ‘Omo Baba Olowo’, (OBO), is now set to stake a claim in the lucrative Nigerian oil and gas industry, as a way of diversifying into other ventures apart from music.
The singer, who, beyond the expectation of many, is holding his own in the music industry, will join the ranks of some top Nigerian celebrities that have gone into the oil and gas business, notably the likes of Tuface Idibia, P-Square and D’Banj.
Davido has been at the receiving end of detractors who say without his billionaire father’s money, he will be nowhere musically, but the young chap has proven time and time again that he is not basking on his father’s money to get to where he is.
The awards and brand endorsements he has been picking of late testifies to the fact that he is now his own man. He had this to say in a recent interview: “I have plans to go into oil and gas business with my elder brother next year. I want to do music for 10 years. By that time, I will be 30, and free to rest.”

By Pulse For those who think ‘O.B.O’, David Adeleke, (Davido,) is all about himself, here is another reason to have a rethink because the hip hop singer who clocked 21 years yesterday, showed another side of him by celebrating his day with orphans and some school pupils. The ‘Skelewu’ master took the pupils of Ikeja Government Primary School, Lagos State, by surprise when he dropped by the school and presented the kids with stationery and electronics to aid their learning. After he was through with the school, he paid a visit to the Heart of Gold Children’s Hospice and the Heritage Homes Orphanage, where he showered the orphans with gift items. It was a teary eyed Davido that played with the kids, sang and danced with them as well as taking pictures with the kids who were thrilled by his visit. With this act, Davido has surely endeared himself into the hearts of his fans as well as gaining more admirers.

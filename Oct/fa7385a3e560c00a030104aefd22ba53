By Pulse Director of the ‘unofficial’ leaked “Skelewu” video, Sesan, has come out to reply Davido’s criticism of the video.
Earlier, Davido had claimed on twitter that he never approved of the video, stating that someone had betrayed him and leaked the video. But in a new twist in the saga, Sesan, has replied Davido, stating that the singer actually was pleased, and accepted the video.
“My attention is drawn toward the chaos surrounding the release of the Skelewu video . Myself and my team shot the video for Davido in Nigeria and to the best of my knowledge my client and his team were very happy with the result, when they watched/ and approved the video.” An angry Sesan said.
“If he has since had a change of heart, that is ok. I am not in any way responsible for the release of the video. I believe Davido and myself did a very good job regarding the video production and as a professional of over 10 years.
“I find it very irresponsible and immature if my client and his management publicly put out false statements/comments, in an attempt to tarnish my name, credibility and reputation.
“I remain dedicated, humble, focused and as hard working as ever. Thank you to all my fans and industry professionals. Stay blessed.” He concluded.
It has been revealed that Davido is currently in London to remake the video, this time, under the expertise of UK based filmmaker, Moe Musa. The new video is expected to better the efforts of Sesan.

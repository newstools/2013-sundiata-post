By SundiataPOST, Abuja No fewer than 3,000 youths on Thursday staged a peaceful protest in Awka to press INEC to declare the authentic PDP candidate for the Nov. 16 governorship election in Anambra.   The youths, under the aegis of Anambra Youth Assembly, were led by the National Vice-President, Mr Patrick Egolum and the National Secretary, Mr Anthony Nwakeze.  In a statement signed by the duo and made available to newsmen, the youths said that they were totally against the PDP’s action, which paraded both Mr Tony Nwoye and Mr Nicholas Ukachukwu as its candidates for the election.  “We, in the Anambra Youth Assembly, have resolved in our last meeting to stage a peaceful protest against INEC for allowing Tony Nwoye and Nicholas Ukachukwu to parade themselves as PDP’s governorship candidates.  “It is very clear that every other political party participating in the coming election in Anambra State has only one governorship candidate campaigning.  “But INEC, which claims that it is monitoring the campaigns of every political party, seems to be comfortable with the double candidates of the PDP.  “INEC should disqualify PDP from participating in the election within 48 hours for the commission to gain our trust that it would organise a free and fair election. “We also call on the Federal Government, all security agencies and good people of Anambra State to take this monumental message from the youths very serious,’’ the youths said in the statement Responding on behalf of INEC, Mr A.O. Ewa, assured the youths that their message would be forwarded to the INEC Headquarters in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the placards carried by the youths read: “Anambra Youth Assembly says No to double candidates’’ and “Jega, tell Anambra the PDP” Sent from an iPad
